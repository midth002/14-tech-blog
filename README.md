  ## Description

  This project is similar to a wordpress site, where developers in the tech industry can publish their blog posts. Also, developers can comment on other posts on the web page. This app follows the MVC (model-view-controller) that uses technologies like handlebars, node js, mysql, sequelize and other npm packages. The deployed app is on Heroku, so for a note, it might take a few seconds to load up.
